# DatingApp
This is a small full stack (.NET 8 and Angular 17) application, made for training and learning purpose. It's a simple dating site where users can register, look for interesting people, like other members profile, use all sort of filterings for the search, paging and sorting, send messages and chat with their matches (included Inbox, Outbox, chat system and when the message was read :), also users can write about themselves on their profile page (bio, city, country, interests...) and upload photos to the gallery... There are still some ideas that could be implemented.
Tech stack used: .NET 8 and C#, MSSQL Server, Entity Framework Core (code first approach)... for backend and Angular 17, Bootswatch, Bootstrap... for FrontEnd
JSON Web Tokens for authentication, Cloudinary for photo gallery, CORS support...
